## Music library assignment for PROG

## Languages

# Front-end

PicoCSS, Sass, HTML

# Back-end

PHP, MySQL, phpmyadmin

## Why?

PicoCSS because I read about it yesterday and wanted to try using it <br>
Sass because it's simply just better than writing plain css and I don't want to combine PicoCSS and tailwind <br>
HTML because we have to create dynamic pages using PHP and I don't think creating an API and using React is allowed as it does not follow the learning material of this period <br>
<br>
PHP, MYSQL, phpmyadmin because we're using Docker and any other as mentioned before does not follow the learning material, besides that they are my main go-to's at the moment anyways, I would've prefered to try Laravel but all in due time <br>
